        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however, there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Walnuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
